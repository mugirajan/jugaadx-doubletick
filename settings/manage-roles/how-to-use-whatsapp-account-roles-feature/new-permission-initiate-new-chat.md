# New Permission: Initiate New Chat

We’ve introduced a new permission under **Roles & Permissions** called **Initiate New Chat**. This feature gives you more control over what your team members can do inside DoubleTick, while keeping conversations well-organized.\
\
**📌 What is the Initiate New Chat Permission?**\
The Initiate New Chat permission allows agents to start a brand-new chat with a customer. \
When an agent sends the first message in a new chat:

* The conversation is **automatically assigned** to them.
* They can continue managing it just like their other assigned chats.

This ensures accountability while still giving agents the flexibility to reach out to new customers when needed.\
\
**🛠 Example Use Case**\
Imagine you’ve created a **custom role** for your support agents where they can:

* ✅ Only see and reply to chats assigned to them
* ❌ Not access unassigned conversations

But you also want them to **initiate new chats** with customers when required. \
\
With the **Initiate New Chat** permission enabled:

* The agent can start a new conversation with a customer.
* As soon as they send the first message, the chat gets **automatically assigned** to them.
* They now own the conversation and can manage it fully.

This balances control with flexibility — agents don’t have access to all unassigned chats but can still proactively reach out when necessary.\
