3. Select Permissions:

   From the list of available permissions, choose Read Phone Number. You can also select any additional permissions you want to grant based on the tasks the agent needs to perform.
4. Assign the Role:

   Once the role is created, assign it to the relevant agent(s) by selecting their name from the list of users.

   This will provide your agent with the necessary permissions to access phone numbers while allowing you to maintain control over other access settings.
