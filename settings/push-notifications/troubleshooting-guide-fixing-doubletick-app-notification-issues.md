# Troubleshooting Guide: Fixing DoubleTick App Notification Issues

Are you missing important messages because notifications from the DoubleTick app are not showing up on your mobile device? Don’t worry — this is a common issue that can usually be fixed quickly by adjusting a few settings on your phone.

Follow the steps below to make sure DoubleTick notifications work smoothly:

***

**1. Check Battery Saver Settings**

Sometimes, battery saver modes restrict apps from sending notifications.

* Go to **Settings** → **Battery** → **Battery Saver** (or Power Saving Mode).
* Make sure **Battery Saver is turned OFF**.
* If you prefer to keep it ON, add **DoubleTick to the Battery Saver exceptions/whitelist so it’s not restricted**.

***

**2. Disable App Battery Optimization**

Battery optimization settings can delay or block notifications.

* Go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **DoubleTick** → **Battery**.
* Select **Don’t Optimize** or **disable optimization** for DoubleTick.
* Ensure **Background Activity is enabled**.

***

**3.** **Allow Background Data & Sync**

Without background data, notifications may not come through in real time.

* Go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **DoubleTick** → **Data Usage**.
* Enable **Background Data**.
* Turn **ON Unrestricted Data Usage**.

***

**4. Verify Notification Permissions**

Make sure notifications are not accidentally blocked.

* Go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **DoubleTick** → **Notifications**.
* Ensure **notifications are Allowed**.
* Check all notification categories (Messages, Groups, Other) and allow them.

***

**5. Lock the App in Recent Apps**

Some devices close apps running in the background automatically.

* Open the **DoubleTick** app.
* Go to your **Recent Apps screen**.
* Long-press on the DoubleTick app and select **Lock/Keep Open**.\
  (This prevents the phone from force-closing it.)

***

**6.** **Enable Auto Start / Startup Manager (if available)**

On some phones, apps need permission to launch automatically.

* Go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **Auto Start** (or Startup Manager).
* Turn **ON auto start for DoubleTick**.

***

**7. Clear App Cache (Optional)**

If the app is lagging, clearing the cache can help.

* Go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **DoubleTick** → **Storage**.
* Tap **Clear Cache**.\
  \&#xNAN;*(Avoid selecting Clear Data unless absolutely necessary, as it may log you out.)*

***

**8. Log Out and Log Back In (Optional)**

If all else fails:

* **Log out** from the DoubleTick app.
* **Log back in** with your credentials.

***

By following the above steps, you should be able to restore DoubleTick notifications on your device and never miss an important message again.
