### **Example Scenario:**

Let's consider a scenario involving a subscription-based meal delivery service that offers updates and promotional offers to customers via WhatsApp. A customer who no longer wishes to receive these messages decides to opt out using the provided Unsubscribe button.

1. **Customer Interaction:** The customer receives a message from the meal delivery service containing the latest offers and a prominent Unsubscribe button.
2. **Opt-Out Process:** Upon clicking the Unsubscribe button, the customer's action triggers the Opt-Out action, initiating the opt-out process.
3. **Confirmation Message:** The bot responds with a confirmation message, acknowledging the customer's opt-out request and informing them that they will no longer receive updates or promotional messages via WhatsApp.
4. **Opt-Out Completion:** The customer's opt-out preference is recorded by the system, ensuring they are removed from the distribution list for future messages.
5. **Opt-In Option:** The confirmation message also includes instructions on how the customer can opt back in if they wish to receive updates again. This could involve providing a specific keyword to the bot or accessing a link to re-subscribe.
