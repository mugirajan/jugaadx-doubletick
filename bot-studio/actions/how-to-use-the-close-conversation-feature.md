# How to Use the Close Conversation Feature

Efficiently managing chat conversations is essential for delivering timely assistance and meeting service level agreements (SLAs). With the "Close Conversation" action component, businesses can automate the process of closing chats, providing valuable support to agents in preventing SLA breaches.&#x20;

Let's delve into how this action works and its practical application: 👇

### **Automating Chat Closure:**

* At the conclusion of your bot flow, implement the "**Close Conversation**" action component.&#x20;
* This action serves to automatically close the conversation once the customer reaches the end of the interaction.&#x20;

### **Marking Conversations as Resolved:**

* Upon application of the "Close Conversation" action, the conversation is marked as done and moved to the "Resolved" status.&#x20;
* This designation signifies that the customer's query or issue has been addressed satisfactorily, allowing agents to focus on other incoming inquiries without leaving lingering open chats.

### **Example Scenario:**

Imagine a customer contacts a telecommunications company's support chatbot to inquire about upgrading their service plan.&#x20;

After engaging with the bot and receiving relevant information about available plans and pricing, the customer expresses satisfaction with the provided details.&#x20;

At this point, the bot triggers the "**Close Conversation**" action, automatically concluding the chat session.
