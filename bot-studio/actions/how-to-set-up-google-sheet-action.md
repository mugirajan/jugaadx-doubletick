# How to Set Up Google Sheet Action

The Google Sheet action is a fantastic tool for seamlessly transferring conversation data to a Google Sheet. This allows you to store and organize customer responses for future reference and analysis.

To integrate Google Sheets, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "**Sign In with Google**" button.
2. Choose your Google account and grant access permission.
3. Click on the "**Select a Spreadshee**t" button.
4. A dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to select the sheet where you want to store the data.
5. Once you've selected the sheet, you'll be able to view the header placeholders available in the Google Sheet. Note that the integration takes the very first row as the header.
6. Identify the variables you want to transfer from your conversation data.
7. Match each variable to the corresponding field in the Google Sheet.
8. Ensure that the variables are correctly aligned with the appropriate columns in the Google Sheet to ensure accurate data transfer.

After mapping your data, you'll have two additional buttons:

1. **Delete Column**: This button allows you to delete a column from your data mapping. When you delete a column, it will also be removed from the corresponding Google Sheet.
2. **Add Column**: Use this button to add a new column to your data mapping. Once added, you can then map variables to the newly created column. This makes it easy to adjust your data mapping as needed, ensuring flexibility and accuracy in your Google Sheet integration.
