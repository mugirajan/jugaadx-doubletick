# Limitations & Restrictions of Co-Existence

While Co-Existence allows your WhatsApp Business App and DoubleTick API to work together seamlessly, there are certain **important limitations** you need to know before onboarding.

***

### 1️⃣ Works Only with WhatsApp Business App

* Co-Existence **cannot** be used with personal WhatsApp accounts.
* Only the **WhatsApp Business App** is compatible.
* WhatsApp Web/Desktop apps (Windows) are **not supported**, though WhatsApp Web via browser is supported.

***

### 2️⃣ Business Name Matching Required

* Your **WhatsApp Business display name** must match **exactly** with the name in your **Facebook Business Manager**.
* This ensures Meta compliance and avoids verification issues.

***

### 3️⃣ Warm-Up Period for New Numbers

* Newly activated numbers must have at least **7 days of real conversations** on WhatsApp Business App before onboarding.
* This helps avoid restrictions and ensures smooth Co-Existence activation.

***

### 4️⃣ Backup Limitations

* **Chat backups via Google Drive or iCloud do not work** once Co-Existence is enabled.
* DoubleTick maintains **message history and synchronization** across App and API, so your conversations remain safe.

***

### 5️⃣ Downgrade Required for API Numbers

* If your number is currently on **WhatsApp Business API**, it must be **deleted from Facebook Business Manager** before onboarding via Co-Existence.
* This ensures the number is fully compatible for dual usage.

***

### 6️⃣ Fixed Throughput

* Numbers using both App and API have a **message sending limit of 20 messages per second (MPS)**.
* This is lower than the standard API throughput but sufficient for small to medium businesses.
