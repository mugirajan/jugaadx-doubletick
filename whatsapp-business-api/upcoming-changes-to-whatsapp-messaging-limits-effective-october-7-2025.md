# Upcoming Changes to WhatsApp Messaging Limits – Effective October 7, 2025

Meta is introducing an important update to **WhatsApp messaging limits** that will make scaling customer communication faster, simpler, and more efficient.

Currently, messaging limits are applied to each **individual phone number**. From **October 7, 2025**, limits will instead be applied at the **business portfolio level**. This means all phone numbers within a business portfolio will share the same limit.

For example, if your portfolio has one number with a 100K limit and another with 10K, the entire portfolio will automatically be set to **100K**.

### Key Benefits of Portfolio-Based Messaging Limits

* 🚀 **Faster upgrades** – Limits increase in just **6 hours** (instead of 24).
* 📲 **Immediate access for new numbers** – Any new number you add will instantly share your portfolio’s limit.
* 📈 **Flexibility to grow** – Add as many phone numbers as you need, without buying extras just to increase limits.
* 💰 **Lower costs** – Avoid unnecessary operational costs of maintaining multiple numbers.
* ✅ **No downgrades for flagged numbers** – Messaging limits will no longer drop if a number’s quality rating decreases.
