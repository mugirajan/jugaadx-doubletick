## **Quality Rating**

Your quality rating is based on how people have reacted to your messages in the last seven days, with more importance given to recent feedback. It's a mix of signals from your conversations, like when users block or report your messages and the reasons they give for doing so.&#x20;

To see your business phone number's status, quality rating, and messaging limits, go to **WhatsApp Manager > Account Tools > Phone Numbers** in WhatsApp Manager.

Locate your quality rating under the Phone Numbers tab in your Meta WhatsApp Manager 👆

The Quality Rating column shows different quality states: &#x20;

* <mark style="color:green;">**Green**</mark>: High quality&#x20;
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Yellow**</mark>: Medium quality&#x20;
* <mark style="color:red;">**Red**</mark>: Low quality

If your quality rating becomes low or there's a change in your phone number status, you'll get an email and a notification in Business Manager as a warning. Your status will be either Flagged or Restricted.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Flagged" %}
This happens when the quality rating becomes low. You can't upgrade messaging limit tiers during the Flagged phase. If your message quality improves to a high or medium state within seven days from being Flagged, your status will go back to Connected. If the quality rating doesn't improve, your status will still return to Connected, but you'll be in a lower messaging limit tier.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Restricted" %}
This occurs when you hit your messaging limit. During the Restricted phase, you can't send any notification messages until the 24-hour window resets. You can still respond to messages initiated by customers.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
