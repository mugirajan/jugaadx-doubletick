# Change Your Display Name in Meta WhatsApp Manager

Your WhatsApp Business **display name** is what customers see when they receive your messages, view your profile, or interact with your brand on WhatsApp.\
Keeping this name accurate and professional helps ensure customers recognize your business easily and trust your communications.

If you need to change your display name (for example, to reflect a rebrand, updated business name, or correction), follow the detailed steps below.

***

### 🧭 Before You Begin

Before making any changes, it’s good to know the following:

* You must have **admin access** to your Meta Business Manager account.
* Display name changes apply at the **phone number level**, not account level — so if your business uses multiple numbers, you’ll need to update each one individually.
* Any new display name must comply with **Meta’s Display Name Guidelines** (e.g., it must represent your business identity, not be misleading, or contain emojis or special characters).

### 🪄 Step-by-Step: Changing Your Display Name

#### 🔹 Step 1: Open Meta Business Manager

1. Go to [**business.facebook.com**](https://business.facebook.com).
2. Log in with the account that manages your WhatsApp Business assets.
3. From the main dashboard, select the **business** you want to work on.

This is your main hub where all WhatsApp accounts linked to your business are managed.

***

#### 🔹 Step 2: Access Business Settings

1. On the left-hand side panel, click **Business Settings**.
2. Under the **Accounts** section, select **WhatsApp Accounts**.

This section displays all WhatsApp accounts associated with your Business Manager.

***

#### 🔹 Step 3: Select the Correct WhatsApp Account

1. From the list, find and click on your **DoubleTick WhatsApp Account**.
2. Then, click the **WhatsApp Manager** button.

This will open a new tab or page — the **Meta WhatsApp Manager interface** — where you can view and manage your connected phone numbers, templates, and settings.

***

#### 🔹 Step 4: Choose the Account to Edit

1. In WhatsApp Manager, click on the specific **WhatsApp account** whose display name you want to change.
2. On the left-hand menu, click **Phone Numbers**.

You’ll now see a table showing all the phone numbers associated with this account, along with their display names, statuses, and connection details.

***

#### 🔹 Step 5: Edit the Display Name

1. Under the **Name** column, hover your cursor over your current display name.
2. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) that appears.
3. A window titled **Edit Display Name** will open.
4. Enter your **new display name** carefully.
   * Ensure the spelling and capitalization are exactly how you want customers to see it.
   * Avoid using emojis, excessive punctuation, or promotional words (like “Official,” “Best,” or “#1”).

Once you’re satisfied, click **Next**.

***

#### 🔹 Step 6: Submit for Review

Your request will now go through **WhatsApp’s display name review process**.\
This is an automated compliance check to ensure your new name aligns with WhatsApp’s policies.

You’ll see a confirmation message stating that your display name change is under review.

> ⏱️ **Typical review time:** Within 24–48 hours, though it may vary depending on Meta’s review queue.

***

#### 🔹 Step 7: Wait for Approval

Once approved:

* WhatsApp will issue an **updated certificate** linked to the new display name.
* You can then **download and apply this updated certificate** using your registered method (such as through DoubleTick or API registration).

Your new display name will then appear for users in chats, notifications, and business information sections.

***

### 🔁 How Often You Can Change the Display Name

* Each WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) can change display names **up to 10 times within a 30-day period**.
* After 30 days, a new cycle begins, allowing another 10 name changes.
* There’s no way to exceed this limit — even Meta support cannot override it.

> **Tip:** Try to finalize your desired name before submitting it to avoid using up your allowed changes quickly.

### ⚠️ Important Notes and Best Practices

1. **Approval Required:**\
   Even though display name reviews are no longer required when first starting with the WhatsApp Business Platform, **any name change** still requires approval before it becomes active.
2. **Compliance Rules:**\
   The new display name must:
   * Clearly represent your business identity.
   * Match the branding on your website or official materials.
   * Avoid generic names like “Customer Support” or “Shop.”
   * Not contain misleading, offensive, or unrelated words.
3. **Consistency Matters:**\
   Keep your display name consistent with your DoubleTick account name, website, and social media profiles to avoid confusion and ensure faster approvals.
4. **If Your Request Is Rejected:**\
   Review WhatsApp’s **Display Name Guidelines** in the Meta Business Help Center, correct the issue, and resubmit. Common rejection reasons include using:
   * Emojis or symbols
   * Promotional terms (“Best Deals,” “Discount Store”)
   * Incomplete or vague names (“My Business,” “Support Team”)
