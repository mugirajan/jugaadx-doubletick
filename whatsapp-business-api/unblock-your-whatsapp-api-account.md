# Unblock Your WhatsApp API Account

If your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) has been restricted, it means Meta detected a potential policy violation or unusual activity. Let’s understand what happens during a restriction, how to identify the reason, and the exact steps to appeal and regain access.

***

#### What Happens When Your Account is Restricted

Meta enforces WhatsApp’s **Business Messaging Policy**, **Commerce Policy**, and **Terms of Service** to keep the platform secure. Violations can result in:

* Temporary messaging blocks (1–7 days)
* Suspension of adding new phone numbers
* An indefinite lock on your account (until appeal review)
* Permanent disabling in case of repeated or severe violations

> **Note:** During a restriction, you won’t be able to send messages or create new templates.

Severe violations like scams, illegal product sales, or child exploitation can lead to immediate and permanent removal from the platform.

***

#### How You’ll Be Notified and How to Appeal

When Meta restricts your account, you’ll receive notifications through:

* **Meta Business Manager / WhatsApp Manager**
* **Emails** to all Business Manager admins
* **Webhook alerts** (if subscribed)

You can review the exact violation details and submit an appeal directly from **Business Support Home** in Meta Business Suite.\\
