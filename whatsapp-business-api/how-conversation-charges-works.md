# How Conversation Charges Works

***

## What happens if you send templates of different categories in the same 24-hour conversation window?

<mark style="color:green;">**Any time a template message is delivered, it will result in a conversation charge unless it is sent in a conversation of the same category**</mark>

### Example 1: Opening a Utility Conversation inside a Marketing Conversation

A marketing conversation is opened at 3:40 when a marketing template message is delivered

Later, with the marketing conversation still open, a utility template is delivered at 6:00

This opens a separate utility conversation. *<mark style="color:green;">The result is one charge for a marketing conversation and one charge for a utility conversation</mark>*

### Example 2: Two templates of the same category result in only one conversation charge.

A utility conversation is opened at 9:00 when a utility template message is delivered

Later, with the utility conversation still open, another utility template message is delivered at 11:00

There is no new conversation charge because the template category used within the open conversation window did not change. *<mark style="color:green;">The result is one utility conversation charge</mark>*

### Example 3: One template with both utility and marketing content

A template that includes content that is both utility and marketing based on Meta template guidelines is delivered, then

Whenever marketing content is identified in a template, the template will be categorized as marketing. *<mark style="color:green;">The result is one marketing conversation charge.</mark>*
