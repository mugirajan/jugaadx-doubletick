# Supercharge Your WhatsApp Marketing with the Conversions API Add-On in DoubleTick

Are you running **Click-to-WhatsApp (CTWA) ads** but unsure which campaigns are actually converting? Are you tired of guessing which ads bring in leads and which ones just drain your budget?

It’s time to take full control of your WhatsApp marketing with **DoubleTick’s Conversions API (CAPI)** — the tool that **turns conversations into measurable results**.

This guide will help you understand what CAPI is, why it’s a game-changer, and how it can supercharge your WhatsApp campaigns.

***

### What is Conversions API (CAPI)?

Think of CAPI as the ultimate **tracking superpower** for your WhatsApp campaigns. Unlike the traditional **Meta Pixel**, which is limited to website activity, CAPI captures **customer actions inside or beyond WhatsApp**.

This means you can track:

* Leads submitted via WhatsApp flows
* Consultations booked through chat
* Purchases made after interacting with your ad

…and more — all **automatically**.

With CAPI, you get **real, actionable insights** about which campaigns are driving revenue and which ones are just wasting money.

***

### Why Do You Need CAPI?

Here’s the problem:

When someone messages you on WhatsApp after clicking your ad, you often **don’t know which campaign, ad set, or ad brought them in**. That leaves you guessing, and guessing = wasted ad spend.

#### Benefit #1 — Full Funnel Visibility

With CAPI, every lead and purchase is **automatically tied back to the exact campaign**. You can finally see:

* Which campaigns drive **real results**
* Which campaigns need **tweaking or pausing**
* Your **ROI in clear numbers**

**Here’s a quick comparison:**

| Metric                    | With CAPI | Without CAPI |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Conversations Started     | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes        |
| Leads Submitted           | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No         |
| Cost per Lead             | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No         |
| Purchases                 | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No         |
| Cost per Purchase         | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No         |
| Return on Ad Spend (RoAS) | ✅ Yes\*   | ❌ No         |

\*Only if purchase value is passed correctly.

#### Benefit #2 — Smarter Ad Optimisation

Meta’s algorithm uses your CAPI signals to **optimise campaign delivery**. That means:

* Lower **Cost per Qualified Lead**
* Lower **Cost per Purchase**
* Higher ROI, automatically

Your campaigns start **working smarter**, not harder.

### Is CAPI Right for You?

Before diving in:

1. **Are you running Click-to-WhatsApp (CTWA) ads?**\
   CAPI only works with CTWA campaigns. If your leads don’t carry a **Click ID (clid)**, Meta will show:
2. **What’s your goal with CTWA ads?**\
   Ask yourself:
   * Are you driving **store walk-ins** or offline visits?
   * Are you retargeting **warm leads** with custom audiences?
   * Are you converting inquiries to **purchases or consultations inside WhatsApp**?

Understanding your goal helps you **measure what matters most** with CAPI.
