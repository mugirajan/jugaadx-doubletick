**Why Does This Error Occur?**

DoubleTick  has a restriction where only 30 groups or broadcast lists can be created in a single instance. If you attempt to create more than 30 groups in one go, DoubleTick will display this error.

For example, if your Excel sheet contains more than 30 broadcast lists or channels to upload, the platform will prevent the action, resulting in this error message.

**How to Resolve This Error**

To bypass the limitation, follow these steps:

1. Split the Data into Two or More Excel Sheets
   * If your original Excel sheet contains more than 30 broadcast lists, divide the data into multiple sheets.
   * Ensure that each sheet has 30 or fewer broadcast lists.
2. Upload the Sheets Separately
   * Once split, upload each Excel sheet one at a time.
   * This ensures that each batch adheres to the 30-group limit.
3. Verify Success
   * After uploading all sheets, confirm that all broadcast lists or channels have been created successfully.

**Example**

Let’s say you need to create 45 broadcast lists:

* Create two Excel sheets:
  * Sheet 1: Contains the first 30 broadcast lists.
  * Sheet 2: Contains the remaining 15 broadcast lists.
* Upload Sheet 1 first, then Sheet 2.

This simple adjustment prevents the error and allows you to achieve your goal without any interruptions.

**Best Practices**

* Plan Ahead: When preparing your broadcast list data, check the total number of lists beforehand.
* Keep it Organized: Label and store your sheets clearly to avoid confusion when working with multiple uploads.
* Follow WhatsApp API Guidelines: Adhering to these rules ensures smooth operation and avoids unnecessary errors.

By understanding and following these steps, DoubleTick users can efficiently manage broadcast list creation without encountering the "Only 30 Groups Can Be Created at One Time" error. Should you need further assistance, our support team is always here to help!
