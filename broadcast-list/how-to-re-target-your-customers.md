# How to Re-Target Your Customers

***

After broadcasting a template message to a set of contacts, if you wish to re-target customers who showed interest, you can effortlessly do so.

* To target a specific audience, open the broadcast whose audience you want to retarget.
* Within the broadcast, you'll find the broadcast summary displaying various metrics or segments such as sent, delivered, unread, read, replied, etc. Additionally, it will also display segments of the buttons available in the message, allowing you to see how many clicked on a particular button.

**Now, you can not only view the total count, but also see which broadcast members have responded to a particular action**

* To view members of a particular segment, click on the segment, and on the right-hand side, a list of all the customers who responded to that segment will be displayed.
* For example, to view all customers who clicked replied to the message, simply navigate to the broadcast summary and click on "Replied."
