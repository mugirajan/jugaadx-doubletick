# How CTWA Retargeting Works with DoubleTick

Turning Conversations into Smart Marketing CTWA Retargeting becomes much simpler and more powerful when combined with **DoubleTick** — because DoubleTick helps you manage, organize, and understand your WhatsApp interactions efficiently.

Let’s break down how it all fits together.

***

#### 🧩 The Meta and DoubleTick Connection

Meta (the company behind Facebook and Instagram) allows businesses to create **Custom Audiences** — lists of users to whom you can show specific ads.

When your CTWA ads drive users to WhatsApp, **DoubleTick** automatically captures and organizes those leads.\
This means every contact, message, and number from your CTWA campaigns is stored and accessible in your DoubleTick workspace.

Once you have that data, you can:

1. Export your WhatsApp contact list from DoubleTick.
2. Upload it into **Meta Ads Manager** as a **Customer List Custom Audience**.
3. Use it to show targeted ads only to those users who’ve already chatted with you.

When these users click your new ads, they’re taken straight back into WhatsApp — into the same chat thread.\
It’s simple, closed-loop communication:\
**Ad → WhatsApp → Retargeted Ad → WhatsApp again.**

#### 💡 What Makes This Integration Work So Well

   You don’t have to track visitors through pixels or forms — your WhatsApp chat history becomes your marketing database.
2. **Real Conversations, Real Data:**\
   DoubleTick ensures every lead, message, and contact is captured securely and systematically.
3. **Targeting the Right People:**\
   Instead of broad audiences, you focus only on users who’ve already engaged — improving efficiency and reducing wasted ad spend.

   Users don’t switch platforms — they see your ad, click, and continue chatting on WhatsApp, exactly where they left off.
