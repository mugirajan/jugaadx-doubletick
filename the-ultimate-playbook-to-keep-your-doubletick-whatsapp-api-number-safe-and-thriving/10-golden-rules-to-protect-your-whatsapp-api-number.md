# 10 Golden Rules to Protect Your WhatsApp API Number

### 1️⃣ The Golden Rule: Only Message People Who WANT You ❤️

* Imagine you walk into someone’s home uninvited… awkward, right? That’s what happens when you message people without permission.
* Always get **opt-in consent** → online form, QR scan, checkout checkbox, or a “Reply YES” flow.

✅ *Good Example*:\
“Hi Riya, thanks for signing up! We’ll send you order updates and special offers on WhatsApp. Reply STOP anytime.”

❌ *Bad Example*:\
Sending a promo to a random list you bought. (Spam alert 🚨 = block + report = danger for your API).

**Why this protects your number** → Meta loves when users expect your messages. Zero surprises = zero complaints.

***

### 2️⃣ Play by the 24-Hour Rule ⏳

* If a customer messages you, you’ve got a 24-hour magic window to reply with *anything* (free chat).
* After 24 hours? Use an **approved template** only.

✅ Example: Customer says “Where’s my order?” → reply anytime in 24 hrs.\
❌ Example: Sending them a discount message 2 days later without a template.

**Why this protects your number** → keeps you in Meta’s “green zone” and avoids penalties.

***

### 3️⃣ Templates: Dress Right for the Occasion 👗👔

Every template has a category → Utility, Marketing, or Authentication. Pick the right outfit for the right party.

* **Utility** → service updates (“Your order is shipped”)
* **Marketing** → promos & offers (“20% off today”)
* **Authentication** → OTPs (“Your code is 54321”)

✅ Good:\
“Hi Aditi, your appointment is confirmed for 4 PM.” (Utility)

❌ Bad:\
“Hi Aditi, your appointment is confirmed. Also, here’s 20% off hair spa!” (Mixed up! Should be Marketing, not Utility).

**Why this protects your number** → No template mix-ups = no Meta red flags.

***

### 4️⃣ Stop Cold Broadcasting 🥶 → Start Warm Conversations 🔥

Cold blasting = 🚫. Warm, targeted audiences = ❤️.

* Use **Custom Audiences** → past buyers, recent leads.
* Use **Lookalikes** → people who *resemble your best customers*.
* Retarget people who clicked your ads → they already showed interest.

✅ Good: Send “Thanks for shopping last month, here’s early access to our festive sale.”\
❌ Bad: Blast 20,000 random numbers with “BIG SALE TODAY!!!”

**Why this protects your number** → Warm = fewer complaints, more replies. Cold = high spam reports → restriction risk.

***

### 5️⃣ Spice Up Your Messages 🌶️ (Content that Clicks)

* Keep it short, friendly, personal.
* Add value: updates, reminders, guides, deals.
* Use media: 📸 images, 🎥 videos, 📄 PDFs, 🎯 CTA buttons.

✅ Good:\
“Hi Aarav! Your AC service is booked for 12 Sep. Tech: Raju (📞 9xxx). Tap below to confirm 👇 \[Confirm Booking]”

❌ Bad:\
“AC SERVICE DISCOUNT. CALL NOW!!!”

**Why this protects your number** → Fun, helpful messages = happy customers = positive engagement = Meta loves you.

***

### 6️⃣ Don’t Be Pushy 🚦 (Cadence & Frequency)

* 1-2 messages a day is more than enough.
* Give space → follow-up after 24–72 hours if no reply.
* Ramp campaigns slowly: 100 → 500 → 2000 (test engagement before scaling).

✅ Smart Flow:\
Day 1: Order update\
Day 3: Feedback request\
Day 7: Personalized offer

❌ Spam Flow:\
3 promos in 1 day → instant blocks.

**Why this protects your number** → Prevents the dreaded “131056 error” (too many messages too fast).

***

### 7️⃣ Always Offer a Way Out 🏃‍♂️

Let users unsubscribe anytime. Simple “STOP” is enough.

✅ Good: “Reply STOP to unsubscribe. You won’t hear from us again (promise 🤞).”\
❌ Bad: Keep messaging even when someone says “I don’t want updates.”

**Why this protects your number** → Users feel in control = fewer complaints. Meta notices when you ignore opt-outs (big danger).

***

### 8️⃣ Track Your Health 🩺

Check your **Account Quality** in Facebook Business Manager: Green ✅, Yellow ⚠️, Red ❌.

Also monitor:

* Block rate → keep Quality rate high
* Opt-out rate → keep low
* Response rate → higher = better
* Template approvals → if rejections pile up, rethink your wording

**Why this protects your number** → Early signs help you fix before Meta steps in.\\
