# How to Manage Conversations

## Mark Read

You have the ability to mark a conversation as read when the customer replies, indicating the end of the chat. This action removes the chat from the unread section and moves it to the read.

To mark a conversation as read in the chat window, simply click on the three dots menu <img src="https://2303112206-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F53n17VnOICC1LtDqlENV%2Fuploads%2F7H8MeTCASPL8rNe7PCWG%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=afe52fcf-ef75-4307-a33d-174ef5554e12" alt="" data-size="line">and select "**Mark Read**." This action instantly marks the conversation as read

## Close Conversation

Once a customer query is resolved, you can mark the conversation as "done" by clicking on the "<mark style="color:green;">**Tick Mark**</mark>" button on the home screen <img src="https://2303112206-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F53n17VnOICC1LtDqlENV%2Fuploads%2FBtUPGPY4ioxz60W3CAKQ%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=438f50c4-fea7-4909-a3b6-0514ab824b4d" alt="" data-size="line">

This action signifies the completion of the conversation

Later, you can locate the chat under the "**Resolved**" filter for easy reference and management of resolved queries.

## Open Conversation

In case you've marked a conversation as done, it will automatically reopen when the customer replies again. The chat will then transition from the resolved status back to the unread status, ensuring that you can promptly attend to any further communication from the customer.

To open a chat, you can select the specific conversation you want to reopen. Then, at the bottom of the screen, click on the "<mark style="color:green;">**Tap to Open Again**</mark>" button. This action will reopen the chat, allowing you to continue the conversation with the customer.

If the chat is still within the 24-hour window, you will have the ability to send your message directly. However, if the 24-hour window has elapsed, you will need to initiate communication by sending a template message
