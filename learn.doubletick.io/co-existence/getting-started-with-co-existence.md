# Getting Started with Co-Existence

#### 🌟 What is Co-Existence?

Co-Existence is a revolutionary capability introduced by Meta that allows Indian businesses to use the **same WhatsApp number** both on:

* The **WhatsApp Business App** on their mobile phone, and
* The **DoubleTick Platform** (powered by the WhatsApp Business API).

Before Co-Existence, businesses had to make a difficult choice — either use the app for personal communication or use the API for automation and analytics.\
Now, you no longer have to choose. With Co-Existence, you can enjoy **both automation and convenience** at the same time.

In simple words, you can:

* Continue chatting with your customers from your **mobile WhatsApp Business App**, and
* Run campaigns, automate workflows, and track performance via **DoubleTick Dashboard** — using **the same number**.

***

#### 💡 Why It Matters

Co-Existence bridges the gap between **human touch** and **automation**.\
Your agents can answer customer queries directly through their phone app while marketing or support messages are automatically sent via DoubleTick.\
It’s perfect for businesses that want to stay personal, local, and fast — while still using automation to scale.

#### ✅ Who Can Use Co-Existence?

To use this feature, make sure:

* You are using the **WhatsApp Business App (not the personal WhatsApp)**.
* The app version is **2.24.17 or higher**.
* Your business number is **active in India**.
* The number is **not banned or restricted** by WhatsApp.
* You have a **Facebook Business Manager** and a **DoubleTick account**.
