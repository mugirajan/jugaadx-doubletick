# How to Create an OpenAI Secret API Key and Connect It to DoubleTick

#### **Step 1: Create a Secret API Key**

1️ **Go to the API Keys Page**

* Visit <https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys>
* Log in with your OpenAI account.

2️ **Click “Create Secret Key”**

* Click the **“Create new secret key”** button.

3️ **Define Ownership**

* If the key is for your personal use, choose **Personal account**.
* If the key is for your team or company, choose **Service account** and assign it to your organization.

4️ **Name Your Key**

* Give your key a clear name — e.g., “DoubleTick Integration” — so you remember what it’s for.

5️ **Select a Project**

* If you already have a project, you can assign the key to it.
* If not, you can keep it under the **Default Project**.

6️ **Set Permissions**

* You can choose to restrict which models and capabilities the key can access.
* For most use cases, it’s fine to allow **Full Access** to models.

7️ **Click “Create Secret Key”**

* Once generated, **copy your secret key immediately** — you won’t be able to see it again later!
