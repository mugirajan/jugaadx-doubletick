# Using Your CTWA Custom Audience in Meta Ads Manager

Once you’ve created your **Custom Audience** using your CTWA leads, you’re ready to use it in an actual ad campaign.\
This next step connects everything — it’s where you tell Meta,\
“Show this ad only to people who’ve already chatted with my business on WhatsApp.”

This guide walks you through **how to select your Custom Audience as the target audience** while creating a Click-to-WhatsApp (CTWA) ad.

***

### 🧭 Why This Step Matters

Your **Custom Audience** represents users who already know your business — people who’ve previously interacted, chatted, or shown interest.\
By using that audience in your ad setup, you ensure:

* You’re reaching warm leads, not cold prospects.
* Your ad spend is focused on people more likely to respond.
* Your campaigns feel more relevant and personal.

Let’s walk through how to put your audience to use.

#### 🔹 Step 1: Open Meta Ads Manager

1. Go to [facebook.com/adsmanager](https://facebook.com/adsmanager).
2. Click the **green “Create” button** to start a new campaign.
3. Choose your campaign objective — for CTWA campaigns, this will usually be:
   * **“Engagement” → “Send Message”**, or
   * **“Sales” → “WhatsApp”** (if available in your account).

> **Tip:** The “Send Message” objective is most commonly used for Click-to-WhatsApp ads.

Click **Continue** to move ahead.

#### 🔹 Step 2: Set Up Your Campaign Basics

Give your campaign a clear name so it’s easy to identify later.\
Example:

* `CTWA Retargeting - Reconnected Leads - Oct 2025`
* `WhatsApp Retargeting - Abandoned Chats`

You can leave most campaign-level settings as default and click **Next** to move to the Ad Set section — where your targeting options live.

***

#### 🔹 Step 3: Go to the “Ad Set” Level

This is where you choose **who will see your ad** — your audience, placements, and schedule.

Under the section **“Audience”**, you’ll see several options:

* **Custom Audiences**
* **Location**
* **Age**
* **Gender**
* **Detailed Targeting**

We’ll focus on the first one — Custom Audiences.

***

#### 🔹 Step 4: Select Your Custom Audience

1. Click on the field labeled **“Custom Audiences.”**
2. A dropdown list will appear with all your available audiences.
3. Find and select the **Custom Audience** you created earlier — for example:
   * `CTWA Leads - All Chats`
   * `WhatsApp Replied Last 60 Days`
   * `CTWA Product X Interested Users`

Once selected, Meta automatically fills the targeting section with that audience.

> **Important:**
>
> * You can select more than one audience if needed.
> * Make sure to **exclude existing customers** (if you have a separate audience for them) to avoid showing ads unnecessarily.

***

#### 🔹 Step 5: Refine Your Targeting (Optional)

You can still adjust location, age, and gender settings if needed — but usually, CTWA retargeting audiences are already specific enough.

> **Best Practice:**\
> Avoid narrowing your Custom Audience further unless you’re testing something specific (like region-based retargeting).\
> The idea is to let Meta find everyone who matches your CTWA list.

***

#### 🔹 Step 6: Choose Your Ad Placements

Scroll down to the **Placements** section.\
Here, you can choose between:

* **Advantage+ Placements** (recommended for most users)
* **Manual Placements** (if you want to select platforms like Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, or Stories manually).

For CTWA ads, both Facebook and Instagram placements work well, since they both support the **“Send Message” → “WhatsApp”** action.

***

#### 🔹 Step 7: Connect Your WhatsApp Business Account

In the **Messaging Apps** section, choose:

* **WhatsApp** as the messaging destination.
* Select your **verified WhatsApp Business number** connected via DoubleTick.

This ensures that when users click the ad, the chat opens in your official WhatsApp channel — where your DoubleTick automation, bot, or team can respond.

***

#### 🔹 Step 8: Review and Continue

After selecting your audience and ad destination:

* Double-check your Custom Audience name.
* Review your estimated reach — this helps confirm that Meta has successfully matched your uploaded contacts.
* Click **Next** to move to the “Ad Level,” where you’ll set your ad creative (image, caption, and call-to-action).

### 💡 Tips for Using Your Custom Audience Effectively

1. **Name Your Campaign Clearly:**\
   Include the audience name in your campaign or ad set title — it helps track results later.
2. **Avoid Repetition:**\
   Don’t show multiple ads to the same Custom Audience too frequently. Give a few days’ gap between campaigns.
3. **Update Regularly:**\
   Every few weeks, upload a fresh list from DoubleTick to keep your Custom Audience updated with the latest leads.
4. **Exclude Overlapping Audiences:**\
   If you’re running different retargeting ads (e.g., “All Leads” vs. “Purchased”), use exclusions to avoid overlap.
5. **Monitor Performance:**\
   Watch metrics like “Message Replies” and “Cost per Result.” These tell you how well your Custom Audience is responding.

### 🧭 Key Takeaway

Using a Custom Audience in your CTWA ads bridges the gap between **marketing and conversation**.\
It allows you to focus on users who’ve already interacted with you — delivering more relevant, timely, and contextual ads.

It’s not about selling harder — it’s about **continuing the dialogue** with users who already know and trust your business.
