# How Customers Respond to Business-Initiated Calls Request

### Understanding Call Permission Requests on DoubleTick

When your business sends a **call permission request** to a WhatsApp user, the user has full control over whether you can call them.\
This ensures a **safe, trusted, and compliant communication experience** for both businesses and customers.

DoubleTick now provides **two clear response options** for customers:

#### 1. ⏳ Temporarily Allow (7 Days)

* The customer grants **temporary permission** for your business to place outbound WhatsApp calls.
* This permission remains valid for **7 calendar days (168 hours)** from the time of approval.
* During this period, your team can place multiple outbound calls (within daily call limits).
* After 7 days, the permission **automatically expires**, and your team cannot place new calls unless a fresh permission request is approved.

**Example:**\
Customer selects *Temporarily Allow* → Calls are valid for 7 days → After 7 days, permission expires → A new permission request must be sent before calling again.

***

#### 2. ❌ Decline

* The customer **denies permission** for your business to place calls.
* Calls cannot be made until the customer updates their permission or interacts with a new request.
* Even after rejecting, customers can **grant permission later** if they change their mind.

**Example:**\
Customer clicks *Decline* → Your team cannot call → You may send a new permission request later, following WhatsApp’s allowed limits.

### 🔁 How It Works in Practice

1. Your business sends a **call permission request template** to the customer.
2. The customer chooses one of the two options:
   * **Temporarily Allow (7 Days)**
   * **Decline**
3. DoubleTick automatically updates the **call permission status** on your dashboard.
4. Outbound calls can only be placed if permission is currently active and within WhatsApp’s allowed limits.

### 💡 Why This Matters

* **Puts customers in control** of who can contact them.
* **Ensures compliance** with WhatsApp’s latest calling policies.
* **Helps your team plan outreach efficiently**, based on valid permission duration.

By following these guidelines, your business maintains trust and ensures smooth, policy-compliant outbound calling through DoubleTick.
