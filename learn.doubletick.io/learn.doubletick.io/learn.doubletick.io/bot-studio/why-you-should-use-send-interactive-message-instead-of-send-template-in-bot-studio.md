When building flows in Bot Studio, many users rely on the Send Template component. While it has its place, in most cases, the **smarter and more cost-effective choice is Send Interactive Message**.

<mark style="color:green;">**Why Use “Send Interactive Message”?**</mark>

**Save on Costs 💰**

•  Every time you send a “template,” it counts as a marketing template usage.\
•  With “Send Interactive Message,” you avoid consuming these templates, reducing your costs.

**No Frequency Cap 🚀**

•  Meta applies restrictions (frequency caps) on how often you can send marketing templates.\
•  Interactive messages, however, are session-based (within the 24-hour user window) and not capped.

**Better Conversations 🙌**

• Interactive messages offer buttons, lists, and quick replies.\
• They make it easier for customers to respond, leading to higher engagement and more conversions.
