For each scheduled broadcast, users can see:

1. **Template Message:** This refers to the content or message template that will be sent out to the designated audience.
2. **Broadcast/Channel Name:** It specifies the name of the broadcast list or channel to which the message will be sent.
3. **Date and Time of the Broadcast:** Users can view the scheduled date and time when the broadcast message is set to be sent out.
4. **Status:** The status indicates the current state of the broadcast.&#x20;

Status is Categorized into two statuses: "**Enqueued**" and "**Completed**."

* **Enqueued:** This status indicates that the broadcast is in line to be executed at its scheduled time. The message is ready to be sent out but has not yet been dispatched. It essentially means that the broadcast is awaiting its turn in the scheduling queue.
* **Completed:** Once a broadcast has been successfully sent out at the designated date and time, its status changes to "Completed." This status confirms that the message has been delivered to the intended recipients as scheduled.

This detailed information allows users to track and manage their scheduled broadcasts effectively, ensuring timely communication with their audience.

## Delete Scheduled Broadcast

Once a broadcast is scheduled, editing its details directly isn't possible. To make changes, you'll need to delete the existing broadcast and reschedule it with the updated information.&#x20;

This ensures accuracy and allows for any necessary adjustments to be made before the broadcast is sent out.

To delete a scheduled broadcast, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the scheduled broadcast you wish to delete&#x20;
2. Click on the three dots icon located on the panel <img src="https://2303112206-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F53n17VnOICC1LtDqlENV%2Fuploads%2FGWkZdBJpE2XlHy7UVmwi%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=eece5934-16f7-4900-95f9-932187abf209" alt="" data-size="line">
3. Select the "Delete" option&#x20;
4. You will be prompted for confirmation. Click on the "<mark style="color:red;">**Delete**</mark>" button to proceed with deleting the scheduled broadcast.&#x20;

This ensures that the deletion action is intentional and helps prevent accidental removal of broadcasts
