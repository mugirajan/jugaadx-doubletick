# ChatGPT Plus vs Pro — Do They Include API Credits?

If you’re wondering whether **ChatGPT Plus** or **Pro** includes **API calls or credits**, here’s the clear answer: **They don’t.**

Below is a simple breakdown&#x20;

***

#### &#x20;**1 What is ChatGPT Plus?**

* **What it is:**\
  A $20/month subscription to use GPT-4-turbo (or GPT-4o) **inside the ChatGPT app or web interface**.
* **Includes API credits?**\
  **No** — Plus does *not* give you any API credits.
* **Use Case:**\
  For chatting, writing, coding, image generation, file uploads, and other personal tasks **inside chat.openai.com**.
* **API usage:**\
  If you want to call OpenAI’s API in your own app or system, you must pay separately.

***

#### &#x20;**2️ What is ChatGPT Pro?**

* **What it is:**\
  Sometimes OpenAI offers a higher tier called **Pro** (e.g., for early access to the newest models like GPT-4o or extra features like more file uploads, faster speeds, or advanced tools).
* **Includes API credits?**\
  **No** — Pro also does *not* give you any API credits or free tokens for the API.
* **Use Case:**\
  A premium upgrade for power users inside the ChatGPT app.
* **API usage:**\
  Still requires a separate API account & pay-as-you-go billing.

#### &#x20;**How Do I Get API Credits?**

**Free credits:**\
New OpenAI API accounts often get **free credits** ($5–$18) as a one-time trial (not tied to Plus or Pro).

**After that:**\
All API usage is **billed pay-as-you-go** based on tokens used — no free tokens come with any subscription plan.\
\
&#x20;**How to get started:**

* Sign up at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
* Add a payment method
* Get your **API key**
* Use the key in your app or script
* Pay for the tokens you use

***

#### &#x20;**Key Takeaway**

&#x20;**ChatGPT Plus and Pro upgrade your experience in the ChatGPT app — not the API.**

**API usage is always separate** — billed per token, with no link to your ChatGPT plan.
