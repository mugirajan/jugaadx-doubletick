# CTWA guide

To create a CTWA ad, you must first have a Meta Business Manager account, a Facebook Page, and a DoubleTick WhatsApp API (WABA) number, all connected within the same business portfolio.

**Here's a summary of the process:**

1. **Set Up Accounts:**
   * **Ad Account**: Create a new ad account or claim an existing one within your Meta Business Portfolio.
   * **Facebook Page**: Add your Facebook Page to the same business portfolio.
   * **WhatsApp API (WABA)**: Ensure your DoubleTick WABA number is linked to your business portfolio.
2. **Create the Ad Campaign**:
   * Go to Meta Ads Manager and click Create.
   * Choose a campaign objective like Sales or Engagement.
3. **Configure the Ad Set**:
   * Select WhatsApp under Messaging Apps.
   * Choose the Facebook Page and your DoubleTick API number.
   * Define your budget, schedule, and target audience.
4. **Design the Ad Creative**:
   * Add your headline, images, and a clear call-to-action (CTA).
   * Publish the ad.

Once a user clicks on the ad, they are directed to a WhatsApp chat with your DoubleTick number. This can trigger automated journeys, lead qualification, and agent routing, all of which are tracked within DoubleTick. \

Additionally, responding to a user's message within 24 hours of their initial contact activates a 72-hour free messaging window, allowing you to communicate with them at no charge.

The detailed process is shared below.
