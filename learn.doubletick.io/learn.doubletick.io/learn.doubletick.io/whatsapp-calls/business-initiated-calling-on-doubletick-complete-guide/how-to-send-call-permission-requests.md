1. Open the **customer chat** in DoubleTick.
2. Click the **Call Icon**.
3. Select the **outbound call permission template** you want to send.
4. Click **Send**.

✅ This method is quick and ideal when you are already preparing to call a customer and want to request permission immediately.

### **Method 2: Via Attachment / Send Template Button**

1. Open the **customer chat** in DoubleTick.
2. Depending on the chat state:
   * If the conversation is open → Click **Attachment → Template Messages**
   * If the chat window is closed → Click **Send Template**
3. Select the **outbound call permission template** you want to send.
4. Click **Send**.

✅ This method is useful when sending permissions in bulk or scheduling them outside of active calls.

### **Example Scenario**

* A customer messages your business late at night.
* You send the call permission request template using either method.
* The customer clicks **Allow**.
* Your team can then place the outbound call the **next day** within the granted permissions.

***

This approach ensures that all **calls are compliant, respectful, and customer-approved**, while allowing your team to engage efficiently.
