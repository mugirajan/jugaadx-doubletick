**What Does "Spam Rate Limit Hit" Mean?**

This error indicates that your messages have failed to send due to restrictions on your phone number. These restrictions are often triggered when:

1. A high number of recipients block or report your messages as spam.
2. Your messaging activity exceeds the allowed limit for your current account status.

To resolve this issue, it’s crucial to understand your messaging limits and quality status in the **WhatsApp Manager**.

**Checking Your Messaging Limit**

To identify the current messaging limit for your business phone number:

1. Go to **WhatsApp Manager > Overview > Limits**.
2. This panel provides details on:
   * Your current limit (e.g., 1K, 10K messages).
   * Steps to increase your limit.

&#x20;                                                  OR

* You can check the same in the home section of the DoubleTick Dashboard

**Understanding Messaging Quality**

Your messaging quality depends on how recipients respond to your messages over the past seven days. It is influenced by factors such as:

* **User Feedback Signals:** Blocks, reports, and the reasons users give when blocking your business.
* **Recent Activity:** Recent feedback is weighted more heavily when determining your quality rating.

**Where to Check Your Messaging Quality**

1. Open the **WhatsApp Manager**.
2. Navigate to **Account Tools > Phone Numbers**.
3. Review your:
   * **Status** (Connected, Restricted, etc.).
   * **Quality Rating** (High, Medium, Low).
   * **Messaging Limits** (number of daily business-initiated conversations allowed).

&#x20;                                                    OR

* You can check the same in the home section of the DoubleTick Dashboard

**Why Messaging Quality Changes Frequently**

For numbers with high traffic, it’s normal to see quality changes within short intervals. This fluctuation reflects dynamic feedback from users and the recency of their responses.

**Best Practices to Avoid the Error**

1. **Target Verified Leads:**
   * Only send messages to users who have interacted with your business recently.
2. **Personalize Messages:**
   * Avoid generic broadcasts and send relevant, value-driven content.
3. **Monitor User Feedback:**
   * Regularly check your **Quality Rating** in the WhatsApp Manager.
   * Address issues causing recipients to block or report your messages.
4. **Gradual Scaling:**
   * Increase your message volume gradually to avoid being flagged.

By keeping a close eye on your **messaging quality** and adhering to WhatsApp's best practices, you can avoid the "Spam Rate Limit Hit" error and maintain a healthy messaging environment. If the issue persists, feel free to contact DoubleTick Support for additional assistance!
