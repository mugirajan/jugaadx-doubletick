# How to Create Dynamic Broadcast Channel on DoubleTick

Dynamic broadcast channels are invaluable for businesses aiming to communicate effectively and in real time with specific customer groups. By creating a dynamic broadcast list, you can automatically add customers to a segmented group based on certain attributes, ensuring that your messages always reach the right audience without manual updating.

**Step 1: Adding Identifiers to Customers Using Bots**

1. Create Custom Customer Attributes or Tags: Start by defining a unique identifier that reflects the segment you want to build, such as a custom customer attribute or a tag. This identifier will be used to categorize customers based on specific characteristics (e.g., “Loyalty Member,” “Frequent Buyer,” “Location”, “Campaign”, “Project”)
2. Set Up the Bot to Tag Customers: Program your bot to automatically assign this identifier to customers when they meet certain criteria. For instance: \
   oWhen a customer completes a purchase over a specific amount. \
   oWhen they visit a particular product page multiple times. \
   oWhen they engage with certain content or promotions.

**Step 2: Filtering Customers with the Identifier**

1. Access the Customer Section: Navigate to your customer section within DoubleTick platform.
2. Apply Filters Based on Identifiers: Use the filter function to find customers who have the identifier you’re interested in. For example, filter customers based on the “Loyalty Member” tag or other attributes you’ve created\\

**Step 3: Creating the Customer Segment**

1\) Tap the +Create Segment Button: Once you’ve filtered the customers, look for the “+Create Segment” button in the top-right corner of the screen

2\) Define the Segment Name and Settings: After clicking on “+Create Segment,” a pop-up window will appear where you can define the segment

3\) Enter the Broadcast Channel List Name: In the pop-up, give your segment a clear and descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the broadcast list (e.g., “Loyalty Member Updates,” “Frequent Buyer Notifications”).

**Step 4: Enabling Dynamic Population for the Segment**

1. Select “Populate Segment Dynamically” Option: In the segment creation pop-up, you’ll see an option to “Populate the segment dynamically.” Tick this checkbox to enable dynamic updates to the list.
2. Set the Filter as the Base for the Dynamic List: By enabling dynamic population, you’re telling the system to automatically add any new customers to this broadcast list whenever they receive the specified identifier. For example, if a new customer qualifies as a “Frequent Buyer” and the bot tags them, they will be automatically added to this list.
3. Save the Dynamic Broadcast Channel: Click “Save” or “Create” to finalize the dynamic broadcast list. Your segment is now set up to update automatically as customers meet the identifier criteria.
