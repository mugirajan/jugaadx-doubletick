# How to Identify and Resolve Duplicate Keywords in Bot Configurations

For users who work with multiple bots on platforms that use the "On Message" feature, encountering errors related to duplicate keywords is a common issue. When two bots are configured with the same keyword, they can clash, preventing either bot from responding effectively. This is a known limitation, and it can lead to confusion and frustration for users trying to troubleshoot the source of the error.

#### **1. Identify the Conflicting Bot**

When the error occurs, a popup will appear displaying the name of the bot that already uses the conflicting keyword.

1. Click on the **bot name** displayed in the popup.
2. This action will navigate you to the bot with the conflicting keyword.

#### **2. Locate and Modify the Duplicate Keyword**

1. In the conflicting bot, review the list of **triggers**.
2. Find the keyword that is identical to the one you are trying to use.
3. **Delete** or **edit** the keyword trigger to avoid duplication.

#### **3. Save the Original Bot**

1. Return to the new bot you were creating.
2. Attempt to save it again.
3. The bot should now save successfully since the conflict has been resolved.

**Tips to Prevent Future Conflicts**

* **Use Unique Keywords:** Assign distinct and descriptive keywords to each bot to avoid overlaps.
* **Maintain a Keyword Inventory:** Keep a list or document of all keywords used in existing bots for easy reference.
* **Regular Audits:** Periodically review your bots and their triggers to ensure no duplicate keywords exist.
* **Set Naming Conventions:** Use standardized naming or keyword conventions to reduce the chance of accidental duplication.
