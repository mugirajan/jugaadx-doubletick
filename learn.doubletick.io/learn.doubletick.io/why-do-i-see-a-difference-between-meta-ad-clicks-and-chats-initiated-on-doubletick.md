# Why Do I See a Difference Between META Ad Clicks and Chats Initiated on DoubleTick?

When running Click-to-WhatsApp ads, it’s common to notice that the number of clicks reported by META (Facebook Ads Manager) is **higher** than the number of chats initiated as reported by DoubleTick (DT). This is expected and normal.

#### ✅ **How It Works**

* **META reports:** *Clicks on your Click-to-WhatsApp ad*
* **DoubleTick reports:** *Actual chats initiated by users on WhatsApp after clicking the ad*

#### **Why the Difference?**

Not everyone who clicks the ad will complete the action of sending a message. For example:

* Some users may click the ad but drop off before sending a message.
* Some may accidentally click the ad and close WhatsApp immediately.
* Some may open the chat but never type anything.

#### **Example**

**Ad Clicks Reported by META:** `500`\
**Chats Initiated Reported by DoubleTick:** `320`

➡️ In this case, 180 users clicked but did not send a message on WhatsApp.

A difference between META’s reported clicks and the chats you see in DoubleTick does **not** mean there’s an issue — it simply shows user drop-off between the ad click and actually starting a conversation.
