The **Resolution dropdown** allows you to control *how data is grouped* in charts:

* **Per Hour** – Best when you’re analyzing short ranges like Today/Yesterday. Example: See hourly peaks in customer queries.
* **Per Day** – Ideal for weekly/monthly patterns. Example: Spot days when SLA breaches spike.
* **Per Month** – Perfect for long-term trends. Example: Compare how festive seasons impact chat volumes across different months.

This flexibility ensures you’re always looking at data in the right context.

### 💬 Response Metrics & Active Chats

The **Active Chats report** is your go-to for understanding conversation volume.

It shows **day-wise chat activity** for the last 7 days.\
Clicking on a number opens **Raw Data** — including:

* Chat timestamp (when the chat started)
* WABA number (which business number was used)
* Contact number (customer’s WhatsApp)
* Messages (all exchanges)
* Direct chat link (jump straight into the conversation)

👉 Actions you can take right here:

* **View** the chat inside DoubleTick
* **Copy** the chat link and share internally
* **Export** the dataset into Excel for deeper offline analysis

This is powerful for spotting **peak activity hours, agent workload, and customer response times.**

### 📑 Types of Reports in Enterprise Analytics

You’ll find **three main report categories**, each designed for a different angle of insights:

<figure><img src="https://2303112206-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F53n17VnOICC1LtDqlENV%2Fuploads%2F3TEzPYTh3FG8huwB9fHH%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=26bf5a8c-6987-429b-a100-6442eddce759" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### 1. **Chats Report**

Track conversation-level performance. Metrics include:

* Active Chats
* SLA Breached Chats
* Waiting at Day End
* Waiting for Response
* Average Response Time
* Average First Response Time
* New Chats
* Irritated Chats

👉 Example: If “SLA Breached Chats” are rising, you instantly know response times are slipping, and you can dig deeper by filtering by **Team Member**.

***

#### 2. **Messages Report**

Focuses on the volume and type of messages exchanged.\
Metrics include:

* Total Messages
* Incoming Messages
* Outgoing Messages
* Irritated Messages

👉 Example: If outgoing messages are high but incoming is low, your campaigns may not be engaging. Use filters to segment by campaign or customer segment.

***

#### 3. **Team Members Report**

This is all about **agent productivity and workload distribution**.\
Metrics include:

* Active Members
* Message breakdown by team member
* Performance analysis by WABA or custom fields

👉 Example: If one team member consistently has a high load of irritated chats, maybe they need training — or maybe they’re assigned to more complex cases.

### 🔍 Deep Dive Example — Irritated Chats

<figure><img src="https://2303112206-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F53n17VnOICC1LtDqlENV%2Fuploads%2FJWIQewEH50co6LbjE72Z%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=66084613-02b0-4a2a-8d14-90145c6765a8" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

“Irritated Chats” = conversations where customers expressed frustration (e.g., negative keywords, repeated complaints).

You can:

* Filter irritated chats by **Team Member** or **Custom Fields** (like Chat Status: Open/Closed).
* Use the **Breakdown Function** to segment by chat status.
* Hover over chart sections to see **exact numbers**.

This helps managers quickly identify if issues are agent-specific, process-specific, or system-wide.

### ✉️ Messages Report Metrics Explained

When you explore the **Messages Report**, here’s what each metric means:

* **Total Messages** – overall volume handled.
* **Incoming Messages** – customer engagement level.
* **Outgoing Messages** – team effort & campaign push.
* **Irritated Messages** – flag for potential dissatisfaction.

👉 Example: If irritated messages spike during a campaign, the content may need tweaking.

### 👥 Team Members Report — Optimizing Your Workforce

The **Team Members Report** shows:

* Who is active
* How many chats/messages each agent is handling

👉 Use this to:
