# Stay Ahead with WhatsApp: Important Updates from Meta

As part of our commitment to helping you maximise WhatsApp and stay competitive, we’re sharing key updates from Meta that may impact how you use message templates.

🆕 What’s Changing?\
Meta is tightening enforcement on how businesses categorize templates. Stricter rules and automated checks are now in place, with actions being taken against misuse.

⚠️ Key Updates:

Since June 1, 2024, Meta has been actively reviewing and reclassifying templates that don’t align with their designated categories. For instance, Utility templates used for promotional content are being moved automatically to the Marketing category.\
\
Starting April 1, 2025, new global restrictions will apply to businesses misusing template categories—especially when marketing content is labeled as Utility.

🚩Consequences of Misuse:

If a business is flagged: A written warning will be issued. <img src="https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2705@2x.png" alt=":white_check_mark:" data-size="line">\

* A 7-day block on new Utility template submissions and category reviews

These updates are part of WhatsApp’s broader initiative to enhance message quality and minimise spam on the platform.\
