# How to Buy OpenAI API Credits and Add a Payment Method

If you want to use OpenAI’s API in your own apps, bots, or systems, you’ll need to:\
&#x20;Add a payment method\
&#x20;Buy credits or enable pay-as-you-go billing\
&#x20;Generate an API key

Here’s a simple step-by-step guide:

#### &#x20;**1️ Log In to the OpenAI API Platform**

1. Go to [platform.openai.com/account](https://platform.openai.com/account)
2. Sign in with your OpenAI account (you can use the same account as your ChatGPT plan if you like).

#### &#x20;**2️Add a Payment Method**

1. Go to: [platform.openai.com/account/billing/payment-methods](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/payment-methods)
2. Click **“Add payment method.”**
3. Enter your credit/debit card details and save.

#### &#x20;**3️ Enable Pay-As-You-Go or Buy Prepaid Credits**

**Option A — Pay-As-You-Go**

* Go to: [platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview)
* Enable **Pay-As-You-Go** billing.
* Set a monthly spending limit (optional but recommended to avoid surprises).

**Option B — Buy Prepaid Credits (Optional)**

* Go to: [platform.openai.com/account/billing/credit](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/credit)
* Purchase credits in fixed amounts ($5, $10, $20, etc.).
* The cost of your API usage will be deducted from these prepaid credits instead of charging your card per use.

***

#### &#x20;**4️ Generate an API Key**

1. Go to: [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Click **“Create new secret key.”**
3. Copy and store the key securely — you’ll use it in your code to authenticate API calls.

***

#### **Important Notes**

* The ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription does **NOT** include API credits — you must add a payment method and buy credits separately.
* New developers often get free credits (e.g., $5–$18) for a limited trial — check your account for eligibility.
* Monitor your usage to control costs: [platform.openai.com/account/usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage)

### **You’re Ready to Build!**

Once your payment method is added and your API key is ready, you can start calling OpenAI’s models in your own apps, scripts, or integrations.
