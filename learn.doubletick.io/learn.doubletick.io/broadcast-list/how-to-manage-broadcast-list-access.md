### Private Access Mode

You have the flexibility to regulate team member access according to your preferences

This mode encompasses three distinct access levels:

1. **Full Access**: Enables viewing members, editing the channel, and sending broadcasts
2. **Send Only Access**: Allows solely the sending of broadcasts; users cannot view members or edit the channel
3. **No Access**: Users are unable to view the channel or send broadcasts
