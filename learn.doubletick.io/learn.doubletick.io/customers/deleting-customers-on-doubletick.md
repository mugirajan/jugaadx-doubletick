**Important Considerations**

a. Permissions for Deletion

* The first three methods require the account owner to grant permissions to team members.
* Permissions can be configured under the Custom Roles and Responsibilities section in the settings.

b. Irrecoverable Action

* Deleted data cannot be retrieved. Ensure you double-check before proceeding.

c. Security and Compliance

* The OTP validation for the Delete All feature ensures data deletion requests are secure and authorized.
