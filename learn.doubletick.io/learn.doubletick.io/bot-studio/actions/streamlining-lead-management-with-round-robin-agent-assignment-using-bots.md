**Functionality of the "Assign Agent" Node**

**Step 1. Choose assignment Method: Round Robin Assignment**

* **What It Does**:
  * The node uses the Round Robin methodology to assign leads or queries to agents in a sequential order. For example, if there are four agents (A, B, C, D), the first lead is assigned to A, the second to B, and so on. Once the last agent (D) is assigned a lead, the process cycles back to the first agent (A).
* **Key Features**:
  * **Fair Distribution**: Ensures all agents receive an equal share of leads, preventing overburdening or favoritism.
  * **Automation**: The bot handles the assignment automatically, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

**Step 2. Select Agents for Assignment**

* **Agent Pool**:
  * Administrators can define the list of agents eligible for assignment.
  * Agents are listed with their names and contact details (e.g., phone numbers) for easy selection.
* **Custom Selection**:
  * The administrator can:
    * **Select All**: Include all listed agents in the Round Robin process.
    * **Filter Specific Agents**: Use the search bar to find and include specific agents in the assignment pool.
    * **Deselect Agents**: Exclude unavailable agents or those who should not participate in the workflow.

**Overview of the Workflow**

The workflow begins with a bot handling incoming leads or customer interactions across a unified communication platform. Once a new lead is identified, the bot automates the task assignment process using a Round Robin methodology.

Key features visible in the workflow include:

1. **Assignment Method**:
   * The "Round Robin Assignment" logic ensures fair distribution of leads among agents.
   * Agents are selected sequentially from a predefined list.
2. **Customizable Options**:
   * Administrators can search for specific agents or select/deselect them from the assignment pool, tailoring the process to their needs.
3. **Continued Engagement**:
   * An option to "Continue on the WA (WhatsApp Business Account) on which the customer responds" ensures personalized follow-up, enhancing the customer experience.

**Conclusion**

By leveraging bots, businesses can enhance efficiency, improve team morale through fair workload distribution, and deliver superior customer experiences. As automation continues to evolve, such systems will become an integral part of modern business operations.
