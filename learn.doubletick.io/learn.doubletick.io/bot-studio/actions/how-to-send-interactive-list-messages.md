# How to Send Interactive List Messages

This powerful component empowers you to craft highly customizable messages tailored to your customers' needs, facilitating seamless interactions and enhancing engagement.

With the Send Interactive List Message Action, you have full control over the content of your messages. You're not limited to simple text; instead, you can add a Header, Body, and Footer to your messages, allowing you to provide comprehensive information in a structured and visually appealing format.

### **Multiple Ways to Use the List Button:**

* **Organize Content into 10 Sections:** Alternatively, you can structure your message into sections, each containing multiple items. However, it's important to note that while each section can accommodate multiple items, the overall message can only contain a maximum of 10 items. Therefore, if you opt to have 10 sections, each section can have only one item, ensuring clarity and avoiding overwhelming the recipient with too much information.

### **Example Use Cases:**

* **E-commerce:** Offer customers a selection of products or categories to explore directly from the message, making it easier for them to browse and shop.
* **Customer Support:** Provide a list of frequently asked questions or troubleshooting options, allowing customers to find solutions to their queries quickly.
* **Event Management:** Allow attendees to RSVP, view event details, or select their preferred sessions or activities directly from the message.
