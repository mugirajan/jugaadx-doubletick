# How to Set Time Delay on Chatbot

Incorporating delays within your chatbot flows can significantly enhance user experience and interaction effectiveness. One essential tool for achieving this is the "Time Delay" action, which allows you to introduce pauses of specified durations between messages or actions. Let's explore how this action works and its practical application through an example.

### **Example Scenario:**

Imagine you're managing a customer support chatbot for an e-commerce platform. After a customer initiates a query, you want to provide them with automated responses while ensuring they don't feel overwhelmed by rapid-fire messages. Here's how you can leverage the "Time Delay" action:

1. **Customer Query:** A customer submits a query regarding order tracking through the chatbot interface.
2. **Time Delay Action:** Upon receiving the query, you configure the bot flow to incorporate a "Time Delay" action. You set a delay of 5 seconds to ensure a brief pause before the bot responds.
3. **Bot Response:** After the delay, the chatbot delivers an initial response acknowledging the customer's query and informing them that their request is being processed.
4. **Additional Interactions:** Following the initial response, the bot can engage in further interactions such as retrieving order details, providing shipping updates, or offering assistance with related inquiries.
