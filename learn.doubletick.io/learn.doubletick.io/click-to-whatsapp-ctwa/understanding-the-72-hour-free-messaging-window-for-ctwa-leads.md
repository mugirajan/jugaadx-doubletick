# Understanding the 72-Hour Free Messaging Window for CTWA Leads

When a user clicks on your Click to WhatsApp Ad (CTWA) or Facebook Page CTA button from their mobile app and sends you a message:

<mark style="color:green;background-color:green;">**🕒 Step-by-step Flow:**</mark>

1. **📩 Message Initiation:**

A WhatsApp user sends you a message via your CTWA Ad or Facebook Page CTA.

This opens a 24-hour Customer Service Window (standard rule).

2. **✅ Your Response Within 24 Hours:**

If you respond within 24 hours using any type of message (template or session message), Meta grants you a Free Entry Point (FEP) window.

This FEP window is valid for 72 hours from the time of your response.

3. 💬**During the 72-Hour FEP Window:**&#x20;

You can send any message type (template or non-template) to that user at no charge.

But remember: if the 24h Customer Service Window closes and you're beyond 24h from the user's last message, you can only send template messages — though they are still free within the 72h FEP window.\

* A user clicks your CTWA Ad and messages you at 12:00 PM Monday.
* You reply at 3:00 PM Monday → this reply activates the 72h Free Entry Point window.
* You can now message them for free (any type) until 3:00 PM Thursday.
* If you had replied after the 24h mark, no FEP window would be opened, and normal charges apply.
