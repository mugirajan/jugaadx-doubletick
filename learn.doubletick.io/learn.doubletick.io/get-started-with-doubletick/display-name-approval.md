# Display Name Approval

When setting up a **WhatsApp Business Account (WABA)**, one of the key steps is choosing an appropriate **display name**. This name appears to customers in your chat headers, and business profile. However, WhatsApp (Meta) enforces strict guidelines to ensure display names are **authentic, trustworthy, and aligned with your business identity**.

Using a display name that **mismatches** with your legal, trade, or digital presence can result in **delays, rejection**, or even **restrictions** on your business account. Below, we explore the reasons for this, along with real-world examples.

***What Is a Display Name Mismatch?***

A **display name mismatch** occurs when the name you choose does not clearly align with:

* Your **legal business name**
* Your **registered brand/trademark**
* Your **website domain**
* The name reflected in your **Facebook Business Manager**

#### ***Why Mismatches Are Problematic***

1. **Impersonation Risk**\
   Display names resembling globally recognized brands or sensitive keywords may be flagged for **impersonation** or **misleading identity**.

   ✅ *Allowed:*

   * **“Nike India Pvt. Ltd.”** using **"Nike India"**\
     ❌ *Not Allowed:*
   * **“Nikee Software”** – This resembles **Nike**, a globally recognized brand, and could be flagged for impersonation.\\

2. **Use of Restricted or Sensitive Terms**\
   WhatsApp restricts the use of certain terms (e.g., "Bank", "Government", "COVID", or potentially harmful words) without proper licensing or approvals.

   ❌ *Not Allowed:*

   * **“Bomb Fashionwear”** – The word **"Bomb"** is considered a sensitive keyword and may be automatically restricted.\
     ✅ *Allowed (only if licensed):*
   * **“XYZ Bank Ltd.”** – Must submit proper banking license documents to get approval.\\

3. **No Clear Connection to Legal or Online Presence**\
   If your **display name does not match** any of your legal/trade name, website, or public-facing brand identity, it will likely be **rejected**.

   ❌ *Not Allowed:*

   * Legal entity: **“ABC Enterprises”**
   * Website: [**www.abc.com**](http://www.abc.com)
   * Display name applied for: **“XYZ Fashion”** → No linkage found, hence rejected.

   ✅ *Allowed:*

   * Legal name: **“ABC Enterprises”**
   * Website: [**www.abc.com**](http://www.abc.com)
   * Display name: **“ABC”**, **“ABC Enterprises”**, or **“ABC Fashion”** (if “Fashion” is clearly shown on the site)

#### **Best Practices for Display Name Approval**

1. **Match your legal/trade name** wherever possible.
2. If using a brand name, make sure it appears **prominently on your website or in submitted documents**.
3. Avoid names resembling **well-known companies or restricted keywords**.
4. Ensure your Facebook Business Manager is updated with correct business information.
5. If necessary, submit additional documentation (trademark certificates, licenses, website screenshots).\

   Using a clear, compliant display name helps establish **authenticity, builds trust**, and ensures your WhatsApp Business Account is approved quickly. Always follow Meta’s naming guidelines and consult their Display Name Policy for the latest updates.

   If you’re unsure about a name, it’s best to **validate it with your solution provider or Meta support** before submitting it.
