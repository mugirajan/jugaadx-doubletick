## How does SLA work?&#x20;

As soon as you receive a response from the customer, the SLA timing will appear on the chat feed. A <mark style="color:red;">**Red timer**</mark> <img src="https://2303112206-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F53n17VnOICC1LtDqlENV%2Fuploads%2Fo2KdRKr2yBUxst8HEjYL%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=bb2e1a49-8d0d-4f2a-bcea-140c33b3fad1" alt="" data-size="line"> will be displayed to indicate the response due time on hover, allowing you to track and manage response deadlines efficiently.&#x20;

Additionally, the response due time will also be visible directly on the chat interface for quick reference.

The timer will continuously update. If the SLA time is breached, the timer message will change from "*<mark style="color:red;">Response Due</mark>*" to "*<mark style="color:red;">Response Delayed</mark>,*" indicating that the expected response time has not been met.

Once the SLA time is breached, the chat will automatically move to the "SLA Breached" filter, making it easier for agents to identify and prioritize chats requiring immediate attention.

## SLA Filter

Once you've configured the SLA, you'll notice a new section labeled "**SLA breached**" in your inbox. This section highlights any chats where the service level agreement has been exceeded, allowing you to quickly identify and address any delays in response times.

The "SLA Breached" section is further divided into filters 👇

1. **All**: Displays all chats that have breached the SLA, regardless of their current status
2. **Awaiting Reply**: Shows chats where a response is expected or pending
3. **Unread**: Includes chats that haven't been read yet
4. **Read**: Consists of chats that have been opened and read or "Marked Read" by an agent
5. **Open**: Displays chats that are presently active, with the chat window remaining open within a 24-hour period
6. **Expired**: Displays chats that have surpassed the 24-hour timeframe, indicating that the chat window has been closed

*<mark style="color:red;">**Note: In all these filters, the chats displayed have breached the SLA, meaning the expected response time has elapsed without a response from the support team.**</mark>*
