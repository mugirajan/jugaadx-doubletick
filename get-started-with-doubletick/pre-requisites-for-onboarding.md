## **Document Requirements by Country**

| **Country** | **Required Documents**                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| India       | MSME Certificate, Utility Bill, GST Certificate |
| UAE         | Trade License & VAT Certificate                 |
| US          | Trade License & VAT Certificate                 |

## Phone Number

The number you wish to set up as your WhatsApp API number must not be registered on WhatsApp. To avoid any complications, it’s recommended to use a fresh number.&#x20;

If you want to convert a number from the WhatsApp Business App to an API number connected to DoubleTick, you must either delete the number from WhatsApp or follow the Change Number procedure.

By ensuring that all the above requirements are met, your onboarding process with the WhatsApp API will be streamlined and compliant with Meta's policies.
