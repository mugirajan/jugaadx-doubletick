# How to Do Meta Facebook Business Verification

Setting a Higher Conversation Limit for WhatsApp Accounts with Meta Verification

In order to raise the conversation limit to 1,000 per day for WhatsApp accounts, Meta now requires a verified account status. This verification process is essential for businesses aiming to access higher account tiers within the WhatsApp Business API framework. However, it's important to note that this verification process is distinct from WhatsApp itself.

***

## Here's a checklist to guide you through the business verification process with Meta:

1. **Ensure Active and Complete Website**: Your company's website should be active and contain comprehensive details such as the company's name, address, and phone number.
2. **Match Email Domain**: The email associated with your account should match the domain of your company's website as provided in the documentation.
3. **Accessibility for Phone Verification**: If phone verification is required, ensure that you can receive the call. If your phone has an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system, temporarily disable it.
4. **Consistency in Business Name**: Ensure that the trade name mentioned in the documentation matches the one used on your website and Facebook page. If there are discrepancies, ensure they are related in some way, such as mentioning them together in the website footer.

After submitting the necessary documentation, you will receive updates via email regarding the progress of your verification.

## Required Documents for Business Verification:

The primary document types that are acceptable for business verification are as follows. Make sure that these documents are not expired and are issued by the relevant authorities.

* **Certificate/Articles of incorporation**
* **Business registration or licence document**
* **Government-issued business tax document**: This could include a tax certificate. Self-filed tax documents are not accepted.
* **Business bank statement**
* **Utility bill**: A utility bill is only accepted for Business address and Phone number. The legal business name must be on the utility bill. A utility bill is not an acceptable document for legal business name verification

If your verification request is rejected, review the reasons provided and rectify any issues before resubmitting the application.

***

## Common Reasons for Rejection:

* Incomplete or incorrect documents
* Language discrepancies
* Expired or illegible documents
* Inconsistencies in business name or address
* Mismatched phone numbers
* Unverified or inaccessible website domain
* Email domain inconsistencies

***

## Additional Remarks

* Business verification is different from the [<mark style="color:green;">verified badge on Facebook</mark>](https://www.facebook.com/help/1288173394636262), personal identity confirmation and the [<mark style="color:green;">verified badge on Instagram</mark>](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/733907830039577). You won't receive a verified badge for business verification.
* If you provide false or misleading information during your verification process, attempt to claim and verify a business that you aren't authorised to represent, or otherwise attempt to circumvent our verification review systems, Meta may prevent your business from being verified, remove your business's verification status or take additional action on the account.
