# How to Link Your WhatsApp API Phone Number to a Facebook Page

## **Step 1: Submitting Your Connection Request**

To start the process of linking your WhatsApp API number to your Facebook Page, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Facebook Business Page.
2. From the Page management options, click on **Settings**.
3. In the Page Settings menu, choose **WhatsApp**.
4. Select your country code and input your WhatsApp API phone number.
5. Click **Continue**.

At this point, you'll be able to track the progress of your request, and if needed, cancel the connection request.

## **Step 2: Getting Your Request Approved**

The approval process depends on how your WhatsApp API channel is set up.

* **Standard flow (no access to WABA)**: If you don’t have direct access to your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA), you’ll need to get approval via support. Raise a ticket with the required details, such as:
  * Your Facebook Page Name.
  * Your WhatsApp API phone number and display name.
* **Embedded flow (access to WABA)**: If you do have access to your WhatsApp Business Account, you can approve the request directly through Facebook Business Manager. Here’s how:
  * Navigate to **Business Settings** in Facebook Business Manager.
  * Under **Requests**, go to **Received**, and click **Approve**.

To verify if the connection was successful, go to **Business Settings** > **Accounts** > **WhatsApp Accounts** > **Pages** in Facebook Business Manager.

## **Step 3: Activating WhatsApp Features**

After the connection is confirmed, you can enable the WhatsApp options on your Facebook Page:

1. Go back to your Facebook Business Page.
2. In the Manage Page section, click **Settings**.
3. Under Page Settings, select **WhatsApp**.
4. Toggle the options to:
   * Enable WhatsApp as an action button.
   * Display your WhatsApp number on your Page.

By following these steps, you’ll seamlessly integrate your WhatsApp API number with your Facebook Page
