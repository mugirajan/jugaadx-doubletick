# What is Frequency Capping

***

### What does Frequency Capping mean?

Frequency Capping imposes restrictions on the quantity of marketing messages an Indian WhatsApp user can receive within a set period. The precise count of messages and the duration of the timeframe are variable – Meta will continually adjust these values, which won't be disclosed.

#### Types of Messages Impacted

It's essential to note that Frequency Capping applies specifically to promotional or marketing messages dispatched using authorized WhatsApp Business templates. Here's the positive side:

1. **Session Messages**: Routine, conversational messages within a 24-hour customer service window remain unrestricted.
2. **CTWA Retargeting**: Messages associated with Click-to-WhatsApp ads remain unaffected by these modifications.

#### **Adapting Your WhatsApp Business API Strategy**

Consider the following key points for refining your WhatsApp Business API strategy:

1. **Emphasize Quality:** Quantity alone is no longer the primary focus. Concentrate on delivering messages that provide genuine value, elevating each customer interaction's significance.
2. **Prioritize Conversations:** Utilize your initial marketing template messages as a gateway to initiate meaningful conversations with users. Once a session is initiated, the Frequency Capping rules become more flexible.
3. **Experiment and Monitor:** Given the fluidity of these restrictions, adopting a "test and refine" approach becomes imperative. Collect data to identify the optimal message frequency for your audience.

#### Troubleshooting

The implementation of Frequency Capping may result in certain *marketing messages* not being delivered by businesses. It's important to note that there won't be a unique error code specifically for this; instead, standard error codes for undelivered messages will be received.&#x20;

The business will receive the error message "*<mark style="color:green;">Message Undeliverable</mark>*" in cases where delivery of the marketing messages is unsuccessful due to factors such as Frequency Capping

Before attributing every failure to Frequency Capping, it's essential to acknowledge that other factors can still influence deliverability.

#### How is the capping determined for a particular WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) with multiple phone numbers?

The capping for a specific WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) with multiple phone numbers is determined by the end-customer level, regardless of the WABA, but dependent on the phone number. The limitation is computed based on the count of marketing template messages that an individual has received from any business. It is not exclusively tied to one particular business.

**The Future of WhatsApp Marketing**

Although Frequency Capping poses a challenge, it motivates businesses to adopt a more deliberate approach to utilizing the WhatsApp Business API. This transformation has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of your WhatsApp marketing, making it more valued by your audience in the long run.
